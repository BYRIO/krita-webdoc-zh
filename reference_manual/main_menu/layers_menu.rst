    Cuts the whole layer rather than just the pixels.

    New layer from visible(3.0.2+)
        Add a new layer with the visible pixels.

    Save Group Layers
        Saves the top-level group layers as single-layer images.
    Import Layer
        Import an image as a layer into the current file.
    Import as...
        Import an image as a specific layer type. The following layer types are supported:
                
            * Paint layer

Convert
    Organizes the following actions:

    Convert a layer to...

        Convert to Paint Layer
            Convert a mask or vector layer to a paint layer.
        Transparency Mask
            Convert a layer to a transparency mask. The image will be converted to grayscale first, and these grayscale values are used to drive the transparency.
        Filter Mask
            Convert a layer to a filter mask. The image will be converted to grayscale first, and these grayscale values are used to drive the filter effect area.
        Selection Mask
            Convert a layer to a selection mask. The image will be converted to grayscale first, and these grayscale values are used to drive the selected area.
        Convert Group to Animated Layer
            This takes the images in the group layer and makes them into frames of an animated layer.
        Convert Layer Color Space
            This only converts the color space of the layer, not the image.

Select(3.0+):

        Select all invisible layers, useful for cleaning up a sketch.
    Locked Layers
        Select all locked layers.
    Unlocked Layers
        Select all unlocked layers.

Group
    Organizes the following actions:

    Quick Group(3.0+)
        Adds all selected layers to a group.
    Quick Clipping Group(3.0+)

    Rotate
        Rotate the layer around the image center.
    Scale Layer
        Scale the layer by the given amounts using the given interpolation filter.
    Shear Layer
        Shear the layer pixels by the given X and Y angles.
    Offset Layer
        Offset the layer pixels by a given amount.

Split...
    Organizes the following actions:

    Split Alpha
        Split the image transparency into a mask. This is useful when you wish to edit the transparency seperately.
    Split Layer

Histogram
    Shows a histogram.
Merge With Layer Below
    Merge a layer down.
Flatten Layer
    Flatten a Group Layer or flatten the masks into any other layer.
