.. _tools_menu:

==========
Tools Menu
==========

This contains three things.

Scripting
---------

When you have python scripting enabled and have scripts toggled, this is where most scripts are stored by default.

Recording
---------

.. caution::

    The recording and macro features are unmaintained and buggy.

Record a macro. You do this by pressing start, drawing something and then pressing stop. This feature can only record brush strokes. The resulting file is stored as a \*.kritarec file.

Macros
------

Play back or edit a krita rec file. The edit can only change the brush preset on strokes or add and remove filters.
