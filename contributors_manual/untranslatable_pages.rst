Technical Pages
===============

Some parts of the contributor's manual are for people who wish to help with the more technical parts of contributing to an open source project.

Because technical computer terms are very hard to translate, people who wish to do technical contributions must know English. This is not just because these pages would be hard to translate, but also because the main developers who work on the program will have a hard time figuring out the names of technical terms in languages other than English. Therefore, these pages will not be translated.
