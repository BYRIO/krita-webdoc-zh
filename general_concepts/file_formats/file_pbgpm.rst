======================
\*.pbm, \*.pgm, \*.ppm
======================
.pbm, .pgm, .ppm are a series of file-formats with a similar logic to them. They are designed to save images in a way that the result can be read as an ascii file, from back when email clients couldn't read images reliably.

It's a very old file format, and not used outside of very experimental usecases.

.pbm
    one-bit and can only show strict black and white.
.pgm
    can show 255 values of gray(8bit).
.ppm
    can show 8bit rgb values.
