.jpg, .jpeg or .jpeg2000 are a family of file-formats designed to encode photographs.

Photographs have the problem that they have a lot of little gradients, which means that you cannot index the file like you can with :ref:`file_gif` and expect the result to look good. What jpeg instead does is that it converts the file to a perceptual color space(:ref:`YCrCb <model_ycrcb>`), and then compresses the channels that encode the colors, while keeping the channel that holds information about the relative lightness uncompressed. This works really well because human eye-sight is not as sensitive to colorfulness as it is to relative lightness.

However, it does mean that jpeg should be used in certain cases. For images with a lot of gradients, like full scale paintings, jpeg performs better than :ref:`file_png` and :ref:`file_gif`.

But for images with a lot of sharp contrasts, like text and comic book styles, png is a much better choice despite a larger file size. For grayscale images, png and gif will definitely be more efficient.
