.bmp, or Bitmap, is the simplest raster file format out there, and, being patent-free, most programs can open and save bitmap files.

However, most programs don't compress bitmap files, leading to BMP having a reputation for being very heavy. If you need a lossless file format, we actually recommend :ref:`file_png`.
