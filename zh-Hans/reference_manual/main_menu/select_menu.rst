    Display Selection

    Show Global Selection Mask.
        Shows the global selection as a selection mask in the layers docker. This is necessary to be able to select it for painting on.

    Scale
        Scale the selection

    Select from Colour Range
        Select from a certain color range.

    Select Opaque
        Select all opaque(non-transparent) pixels in the current active layer. If there's already a selection, this will add the new selection to the old one, allowing you to select the opaque pixels of multiple layers into one selection. Semi-transparent(or semi-opaque) pixels will be semi-selected.

    Feather Selection
        Feathering in design means to soften sharp borders. So this adds a soft border to the existing selection.

    Grow Selection
        Make the selection a few pixels bigger.

    Shrink Selection
        Make the selection a few pixels smaller.

    Border Selection
        Take the current selection and remove the insides so you only have a border selected.

    Smooth
        Make the selection a little smoother. This removes jiggle.
